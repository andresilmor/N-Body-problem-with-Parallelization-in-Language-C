# N-Body-problem-with-Parallelization-in-Language-C

Exercise for Advanced Computing (Informatics MSc, ESTiG-IPB), in resume, the goal was to parallellize the N-Body problem made with serial code from [rosettacode.org](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/N-body_problem) to Parallel Programming/Parallel Computing in Language C, that parallelization should be dynamic, it means that we should not define a fix number of available threads (use of array of threads) and using the pThread library.
